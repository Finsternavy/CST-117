Method Stubs

1.	Write a method that takes two integers and displays their sum.

        public int sumOfTwoInts(int first, int second) {}

2.	Write a method that takes five doubles and returns their average.

	public double averageFiveDoubles(double one, double two, double three, double four, double five) { }

3.	Write a method that returns the sum of two randomly generated integers.

        public int sumOfTwoRandoms(Random one, Random two) { }

4.	Write a method that takes three integers and returns true if their sum is divisible by 3 and false otherwise.

        public bool areThreeIntsDivisibleByThree(int one, int two, int three) { }

5.	Write a method that takes two strings and displays the string that has fewer characters.

        public string displayShorterString(string one, string two) { }

6.	Write a method that takes an array of doubles and returns the largest value in the array.

        public double returnLargestDouble(double[] doubles) { }

7.	Write a method that generates and returns an array of fifty integer values.

        public int[] generateIntArray(int fifty) { }

8.	Write a method that takes two bool variables and return true if they have the same value and false otherwise.

        public bool compareBool(bool one, bool two) { }

9.	Write a method that takes an int and a double and returns their product.

        public double productOfIntAndDouble(int number1, double number2) { }

10.	Write a method that takes a two-dimensional array of integers and returns the average of the entries.

        public int averageOfIntegers(int[][] twoDimensionalArray) { }
